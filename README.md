Nike+ has an interesting business model. Nike provides Nike+ as a free online
service to existing customers. Would it not make sense to provide it freely
as the hub of exercise data for everyone, and act as *the* brand for anything
digitally related to exercise and lure in customers that way?

Specifically, Nike+ does not let you add runs manually beyond its Nike+ iPhone
app or hardware devices. This seems to be an important scenario many.
